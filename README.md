With the MHD-Scanner, you can get points and play games by buying Groceries that expired just a few days ago. Thus you encourage people to buy food that isn't spoiled, but Supermarkets still dispose, because not enough people are buying it. It's a Win-Win Situation, both for the people, who can play games and for the environment.

## 1.0 Installing
First download the repo.
The next step is to install python. This project probably needs python 3.5+, it was created with python 3.7. But you can install the latest version of python (currently 3.10.0).  
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
**Don't forget to tick "Add Python to PATH", "Add Python to environment variables" and "pip"**  

To check if python's installed, open your terminal and type `python -V`.  
If you get an error, go to [Troubleshooting](#13-troubleshooting).

Now check if pip's installed. Type `pip -h` in the terminal.  
If you get an error, go to [Troubleshooting](#13-troubleshooting).

OPTIONAL: Because this project needs a lot of modules from pip, we recommend you to use a [Virtual Environment](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-virtual-environments-and-dependency-managers/). (make sure you are in the main directory)  

Windows:
```
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```



Great! Now install the modules from requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the program with
```bash
python app.py
```

That's it! You did it! Now deactivate the venv:

Windows:
```
.\env\Scripts\deactivate.bat
```

Linux/Mac:
```bash
deactivate
```



**If you want to run the project again, here are the steps:**  
1. **Activate the venv:**  
	Windows:
	```
	.\env\Scripts\activate
	```

	Linux/Mac:
	```bash
	activate
	```

2. **Run the project**  
	```bash
	python app.py
	```

3. **Deactivate the venv**  
	Windows:
	```
	.\env\Scripts\deactivate.bat
	```

	Linux/Mac:
	```bash
	deactivate
	```

## 3.0 Troubleshooting

### 3.1 Installation Errors
**`'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program, or batch file.`**  
That means you haven't installed python correctly, or it's not in the PATH variable.  

Try:

- `python3 -V`
- `py -V`
- `python [PYTHONVERSION.PYTHONVERSION]` e.g. `python 3.10`

If both commands don't work, try to uninstall python and install it with the [instructions above](#11-installing).

**`'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program, or batch file.`**  
That means you haven't installed pip when you installed python, or it's not in the PATH variable.  

Try:

- `pip3 -V`
- `pip -V`

If both commands don't work, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 3.1 Other errors
If you have any other errors, program, or installing errors we didn't mention, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/Jugendhackt/MHD-Main/issues/new) with the tag bug.
Or write an e-mail to mhd.team[at]outlook.de
